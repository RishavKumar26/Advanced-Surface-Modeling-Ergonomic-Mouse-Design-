## 1. Project Overview

This project details the process of designing a highly ergonomic computer mouse using advanced surfacing techniques within SOLIDWORKS. The primary goal was to create complex, organic contours that maximize user comfort, resulting in a model ready for manufacturing analysis and physical prototyping.

## 2. Key Design Highlights

The final model was achieved through a meticulous process focusing on precision geometry and advanced surfacing.

### Precision Geometry Definition
* The core structure and contours were defined using **12 primary 3D sketches and splines**, which served as the underlying framework to control the shape's curvature and flow.

### Advanced Surfacing Techniques
A comprehensive set of SOLIDWORKS surfacing tools was utilized to create the complex, high-quality surfaces:
* **Boundary Surfaces:** Ensured smooth, high-quality transitions between complex curves.
* **Lofts:** Generated transitional shapes between different profile sections.
* **Surface Trims & Extends:** Precisely defined the final contours and edges of the mouse body.

## 3. Final Outcome

* **Watertight Solid Model:** Successfully knitted **18 complex surfaces** together to form a single, watertight solid body.
* **Manufacturing Ready:** This critical step converts the surface model into a robust, manufacturable solid, suitable for further analysis such as:
    * Draft analysis
    * Mold design
    * Physical prototyping
