Advanced Surface Modeling: Ergonomic Mouse Design
This project details the process of designing a highly ergonomic computer mouse using advanced surfacing techniques within SOLIDWORKS. The primary goal was to create complex, organic contours that maximize user comfort, resulting in a model ready for manufacturing analysis and physical prototyping.

Key Design Highlights:
Advanced Surfacing Techniques: Utilized a comprehensive set of SOLIDWORKS surfacing tools, including:

Boundary Surfaces: Ensuring smooth, high-quality transitions between complex curves.

Lofts: Generating transitional shapes between different profile sections.

Surface Trims and Extends: Precisely defining the final contours and edges of the mouse body.

Precision Geometry Definition: The core structure and contours were defined meticulously using:

12 Primary 3D Sketches and Splines: Serving as the underlying framework to control the shape's curvature and flow.

Watertight Solid Model: Successfully knitted 18 complex surfaces together to form a single, watertight solid body. This critical step converts the surface model into a robust, manufacturable solid, suitable for:

Manufacturing analysis (e.g., draft analysis, mold design).

Slicing and printing for 3D prototyping.
